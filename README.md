Environment :-

It is an made in the language Processing which
is a java based development environment.

It was made on a phone with the help of an
Android App named APDE.


Display :-

A Simple Sudoku game drawn on to the canvas.
It is playable with the help of a mousePresses
on computers or on android.

It maybe a bit bad on computers cause the
reference for size and all was with the help
of an android with display Size of 1080Ã—960px.

I used the function fullScreen() method hence
it fills the whole of the screen with the game.
Hence it will not be that blocky or beautiful
as it should be on a android though it will work
on all android devices with correct display.


Sudoku :-

A solved sudoku is generated first and then
Some no. are striked out based on it being 
solvable or not. 

App :-

The APDE app I used had an option to convert the 
Processing sketch to an android app.
Hence it has been to used to make the app 
Named Sudoku.apk
